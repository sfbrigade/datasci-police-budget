# datasci-police-budget

To inform citizens on how much money goes towards police department budgets and how it stacks up relative to other spending.

## Summary

**Objectives**: To better understand how much money goes towards police department budgets and how it stacks up relative to other spending. To visualize budget breakdowns and their evolution over time. To inform citizens about the priorities inherent in their city’s budget.

Budget numbers by themselves don’t tell a full story. It needs contextualization re: comparison to other locales, or the spending on other areas within a specific locale.
