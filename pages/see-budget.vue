              <p class="highlight-number">4.8%</p>
              <p class="highlight-text">per year, compounded over the past 20 years.</p>
              <br />
              <p class="section-text">
                This spending has risen almost every year, including years in which
                the number of crime incidents reported fell.

              <br />
              <br />
              <p class="highlight-text">
                The increase in Police Budget is largely driven by an increase in
                Patrol Officer Salaries.
              </p>
              <p class="section-text">
                Though the city's overall spend on Patrol has increased, sources show that the size
                of the SFPD patrol force has remained largely constant throughout this time period.
                Some of this salary increase may be attributed to the steady rise in the Consumer
                Price Index (CPI) in the Bay Area during this same period of time.
              </p>
              <p class="section-text">
                In contrast, police spending on training has remained relatively stable.
                In fact, between 1999 and 2016, the police training budget has only
                increased by around $170,000.

                    Each member of the San Francisco Police Department is trained at the Basic
                    Academy, where they spend 34 weeks learning state laws, criminal
                    investigations, patrol procedures, firearms training, traffic control,
                    defensive driving, self-defense, first aid, and use of force policies. Physical
                    training and fieldwork include investigating mock criminal scenes, directing
                    traffic, operating police vehicles, arrest techniques, using firearms, and
                    interrogation methods. Following graduation, newly sworn SFPD officers undergo
                    a 16-week field-training program under the supervision Field training
                    Officers at various district stations.

              <p class="section-text">
                Overall since 2015, the number of use of force (UOF) incidents by police
                officers has decreased, largely due to a decrease in the number of
                firearm pointing incidents. In 2015, there were around 2,600 firearm pointing
                incidents while in 2019 there were around 900.
              </p>
              <p class="section-text">
                However, the rates of other forms of UOF incidents have stayed at around
                the same level. This suggests there is still much improvement to be made
                in police training and calls into question the rising budget
                the city allocates towards its police force.

                of people in all UOF incidents from 2015 to 2020 were Black, though Black folks
                only made up ~5% of the total SF population in that same time period.

                In pointing of firearms incidents in particular, there were

                against Black people versus against any other racial group, both in
                absolute terms and as a percentage of the total Black population.

                  The Race and Equity department was
                  established in 2015 to eliminate systemic causes of racial disparities
                  and promote inclusion in
